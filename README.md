iPhone-4-screen-repair
======================

iPhone front panel glass is very important to get the right display. Accidently if it shatters,  its repairing  is not easy. Cause the front panel glass is fused to the LCD and digitizer, so  glass canâ€™t be repapered or replaced individually.  Users have to replace all three (consider as a single unit : Digitizer Touch Panel Screen With LCD Display Screen + Flex Cable + Supporting Frame)  taken as a single in order to successfully working of your iPhone 4.
